'''
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.
'''
# the brute force solution is to have two loop, i and j, then calculate the water between i and j, finally output the most water
# obviously, TLE
# refering the answer, use two points
